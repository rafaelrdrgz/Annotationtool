Even in cases of strict liability there is a requirement to prove that the damage was caused by the defendant, even if there is no need to prove that the defendant was ‘at fault’ for causing it.

These rationales can be roughly divided into justice and economic considerations. Firstly, non-contractual liability is linked to ‘corrective justice’ theories. Corrective justice concerns itself with the gains and losses that one person or company may cause another – it seems unjust that someone may benefit from committing a wrong and thereby cause a loss to someone else or move the risk for that loss to another actor.[6] Non-contractual liability is therefore also focused on ‘making the victim whole again’ after they have suffered a loss through a wrong committed by someone else, usually through means of financial compensation and a commitment to preventing similar wrongs from happening again.[7] Non-contractual liability is the legal expression of the idea that people in society have a certain normative relationship to each other, and therefore should exercise appropriate care.", "word_count": 178, "source_key": "ada_lovelace", "source_name": "Ada Lovelace Institute", "article_id": "ada_lovelace_f1f2940a5c7b", "article_title": "Risky business", "article_url": "https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/report/risky-business/", "paragraph_indices": [9], "score": 6, "priority": "MEDIUM", "score_breakdown": {"absolute_strong": 0, "absolute_weak": 0, "regular_pairs": 1, "linguistic": 5, "semantic": 0, "penalties": 0}, "markers_found": {"absolute": [], "regular": ["benefit", "justice"], "linguistic": ["modal_verbs", "evaluative_language", "causal_inferential", "abstract_nouns", "epistemic_markers"], "antipatterns": []}}

For example, prior to the 2008 financial crisis, some major banks acted more recklessly because they knew they would be ‘bailed out’ by the government if they were at risk of going bust.[11] Non-contractual liability rules apply to people and organisations regardless of whether or not they agree to them.

{"id": "PP1318", "text": "Immigrant crime has become a potent political issue in recent years, and states have rushed to consider bills that would punish them more harshly than citizens. Although an Alabama bill that would have automatically increased the severity of some felonies and misdemeanors committed by undocumented immigrants died in 2025, other measures succeeded. A bill in Florida adding additional punishments for undocumented immigrants passed, but it has been challenged and is on hold. Judges and district attorneys in Alabama are elected, and both play key roles in sentencing. Most defendants take plea deals offered by prosecutors, who recommend a sentence length to the judge. Judges ultimately determine the sentences both for those who plead guilty and those who go to trial. “Judges tend to sentence noncitizens to longer sentences than U.S. citizens,” said Juliet Stumpf, a professor at Lewis and Clark Law School who studies the intersection of immigration and criminal justice. “And there’s some theories about why that’s true, but some of them have to do with maybe the judges or prosecutors who are asking for these longer sentences are seeing these particular noncitizens as more dangerous or more undesirable.” But well before a judge hands down a sentence, bias can factor into a case in a way that leads to longer sentences. “The truth is, we’re almost all saddled with all the packaging we came with,” Madison County District Attorney Robert Broussard said. “If the defendant is from another country in front of 12 U.S. citizens, we’d be kidding each other if we said justice is blind.” If the defendant is from another country in front of 12 U.S. citizens, we’d be kidding each other if we said justice is blind.", "word_count": 282, "source_key": "propublica", "source_name": "ProPublica", "article_id": "propublica_a591d3f76c4d", "article_title": "Immigrants in Alabama Can Face Harsher Sentences Than Citizens for the Same Crimes", "article_url": "https://www.propublica.org/article/immigrants-alabama-harsher-sentences-citizens", "paragraph_indices": [26], "score": 6, "priority": "MEDIUM", "score_breakdown": {"absolute_strong": 0, "absolute_weak": 0, "regular_pairs": 1, "linguistic": 5, "semantic": 0, "penalties": 0}, "markers_found": {"absolute": [], "regular": ["justice", "bias"], "linguistic": ["modal_verbs", "evaluative_language", "causal_inferential", "abstract_nouns", "epistemic_markers"], "antipatterns": []}}

When pushback comes, regulators sometimes cave. “If we do anything anti-grazing, there’s at least a decent chance of politicians being involved,” said one BLM employee who requested anonymity due to a fear of retaliation from the administration. “We want to avoid that, so we don’t do anything that would bring that about.” Mary Jo Rugwell, a former director of the BLM’s Wyoming state office, said that a majority of ranchers in the public lands grazing system “do things the way they should be done.” But some are “truly problematic” — they break the rules and “go above and around you to try to get what they want or think they deserve.” Ranching interests “can be very closely tied to folks that are in power,” she added.", "word_count": 261, "source_key": "propublica", "source_name": "ProPublica", "article_id": "propublica_c13707a437bd", "article_title": "Sympathetic Officials and “Cultural Power” Help Ranchers Dodge Oversight", "article_url": "https://www.propublica.org/article/politicians-help-ranchers-dodge-oversight", "paragraph_indices": [21], "score": 6, "priority": "MEDIUM", "score_breakdown": {"absolute_strong": 0, "absolute_weak": 0, "regular_pairs": 1, "linguistic": 5, "semantic": 0, "penalties": 0}, "markers_found": {"absolute": [], "regular": ["state", "rule", "power"], "linguistic": ["modal_verbs", "evaluative_language", "causal_inferential", "normative_language", "abstract_nouns"], "antipatterns": []}}

In the Montana dispute, Daines’ office, from March 2020 through February 2021, sent a stream of emails to Forest Service officials about the issue, including demands for detailed information about the agency’s interactions with the ranchers. In April 2021, a Daines staffer showed up unannounced at a meeting between the ranchers and the Forest Service, only to be turned away because the Forest Service did not have the appropriate official present to deal with a legislative staffer. But interventions by Daines’ office apparently made an impact. It’s not unusual for people regulated by the government to reach out to their elected representatives, and “constituent services” are a big part of every senator’s and House member’s official duties. But local Forest Service officials involved in the dispute noted that the pressure from outside political forces was leading them to give the ranchers special treatment. “If this issue was solely between the [ranger district] and the permittee, we should administer the permit and end the discussion there,” wrote one Forest Service official in 2020. “Unfortunately, we have regional, state and national oversight from others that deters us from administering the permit like we would for others.", "word_count": 210, "source_key": "propublica", "source_name": "ProPublica", "article_id": "propublica_c13707a437bd", "article_title": "Sympathetic Officials and “Cultural Power” Help Ranchers Dodge Oversight", "article_url": "https://www.propublica.org/article/politicians-help-ranchers-dodge-oversight", "paragraph_indices": [23], "score": 5, "priority": "MEDIUM", "score_breakdown": {"absolute_strong": 0, "absolute_weak": 0, "regular_pairs": 0, "linguistic": 5, "semantic": 0, "penalties": 0}, "markers_found": {"absolute": [], "regular": ["state"], "linguistic": ["modal_verbs", "evaluative_language", "causal_inferential", "normative_language", "abstract_nouns"], "antipatterns": []}}

If our synthesis landed on the desk of those leading digital transformation within government – alongside an extensive to-do list and a myriad of competing pressures – where should they start? We propose four targeted recommendations to strengthen the foundations for AI in the public sector that could be begun in 2025: The lack of evidence on AI’s efficacy, costs, and impacts on services and people is a major obstacle to its successful deployment across the public sector, and to ensuring it is fair, safe and delivers value for money.", "word_count": 174, "source_key": "ada_lovelace", "source_name": "Ada Lovelace Institute", "article_id": "ada_lovelace_520d189c02df", "article_title": "Building blocks: four recommendations to strengthen the foundations for AI in the public sector", "article_url": "https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/blog/four-recommendations-strengthen-ai-public-sector/", "paragraph_indices": [3], "score": 4, "priority": "LOW", "score_breakdown": {"absolute_strong": 0, "absolute_weak": 0, "regular_pairs": 0, "linguistic": 4, "semantic": 0, "penalties": 0}, "markers_found": {"absolute": [], "regular": ["worth"], "linguistic": ["modal_verbs", "evaluative_language", "abstract_nouns", "epistemic_markers"], "antipatterns": []}}

For example, the CPS has been used by the Center for Immigration Studies and the Pew Research Center to estimate a decline in the foreign-born population of around 2 million.

{"id": "AEI20", "text": "For short-run GDP growth to change due to a reduction in net migration, labor force growth and earnings need to change. The direct effect on GDP growth owing to less output created by immigrants is roughly 0.2 percentage points in 2025 and 0.1 percentage point in 2026. Those estimates are shown in the top row of Table 2. In addition to those direct effects, the reduction in consumer spending by immigrants also further dampens GDP growth. In our assessment, the reduction takes businesses by surprise; in response, those businesses take actions, such as laying people off, which have knock-on effects in reducing GDP. Consumer spending is dampened for two reasons. First, fewer immigrants are in the U.S. and therefore are not spending in the U.S. Second, we expect that when immigration enforcement is very salient, immigrants who remain in the U.S. pull back on their spending because they are more uncertain about the future and may minimize going into public for shopping or leisure.", "word_count": 164, "source_key": "aei", "source_name": "American Enterprise Institute", "article_id": "aei_a8648607a7f9", "article_title": "Macroeconomic implications of immigration flows in 2025 and 2026: January 2026 update", "article_url": "https://www.brookings.edu/articles/macroeconomic-implications-of-immigration-flows-in-2025-and-2026-january-2026-update/", "paragraph_indices": [19], "score": 3, "priority": "LOW", "score_breakdown": {"absolute_strong": 0, "absolute_weak": 0, "regular_pairs": 0, "linguistic": 3, "semantic": 0, "penalties": 0}, "markers_found": {"absolute": [], "regular": [], "linguistic": ["modal_verbs", "causal_inferential", "epistemic_markers"], "antipatterns": []}}

Businesses experience a reduction in net immigration both as a reduction in labor supply and as a reduction in demand for their goods and services. Our analysis suggests that the United States experienced negative net migration in 2025 for the first time in at least decades. We estimate net flows of –295,000 to –10,000 for the year.

What is it that ties these lands of opportunity together? If we can understand the most important characteristics of areas where intergenerational mobility is high, then we can be in a better position to replicate that mobility in other communities. I will home in on three characteristics that the study shows correlate most with the lands of opportunity. First, “the strongest predictors of upward mobility are measures of family structure such as the concentration of married two-parent households in the area.” Second, “high upward mobility areas tend to have higher fractions of religious individuals and greater participation in local civic organizations.” Third, “proxies for the quality of the K-12 school system are also correlated with upward mobility.” It is no coincidence that these three factors—high rates of family stability exemplified by married, two-parent households; concentrations of religious individuals; and access to high-quality K-12 education—are strongly correlated to upward mobility at the neighborhood level.", "word_count": 243, "source_key": "aei", "source_name": "American Enterprise Institute", "article_id": "aei_ca4c6645c78f", "article_title": "The 3 Keys to Reclaiming the American Dream", "article_url": "https://www.coolidgereview.com/articles/reclaiming-american-dream-rowe", "paragraph_indices": [6], "score": 3, "priority": "LOW", "score_breakdown": {"absolute_strong": 0, "absolute_weak": 0, "regular_pairs": 1, "linguistic": 2, "semantic": 0, "penalties": 0}, "markers_found": {"absolute": [], "regular": ["experience", "possible"], "linguistic": ["modal_verbs", "evaluative_language"], "antipatterns": []}}

The occasion, however, was notable for one reason: The federal government shutdown had left no usable money in the budget account to finance these payments. How, then, were the troops paid? The answer is troubling. To make these payments, President Trump used research and development (R&D) money that the Department of Defense had left over from last fiscal year—an action that was patently illegal. In addition to being illegal, the move was also unnecessary. There is overwhelming support in Congress to enact legislation to pay the military.

The Dutch government, worried that the Chinese owner was in effect hollowing out the local arm of the firm, invoked an obscure law to seize control of its management in late September. It was in response to this step that China curbed exports of Nexperia’s chips.

The paper, by Xavier Gabaix of Harvard University and Ralph Koijen of the University of Chicago, sets out their “inelastic-markets hypothesis”. This contradicts the textbook argument that money flowing into stocks should barely raise prices, since if it did, demand would fall and return prices close to their starting level. In fact, the paper’s authors find that stockmarket demand is not “elastic” in this way. It is inelastic, and does not fall much as share prices rise. As a result, an investor who buys $1-worth of stocks using fresh cash (or the proceeds from selling other assets such as bonds) pushes up aggregate market value by $3-8.

Few charities ever face this situation, and payments typically relate to legacies where there is evidence that a person’s will does not reflect their final wishes.

To help charities work within the new legal framework, and only apply for Commission authority when needed, the charity regulator has updated its guidance for trustees. The regulator also encourages trustees to refer to its general guidance on decision making (CC27) when considering a moral payment.

To my mind, a more generous unemployment insurance system, with higher weekly benefits and more weeks of benefits, would be better and fairer than UBI. All this will require higher taxes.

More recently, the materials community has been blanketed by a new hype cycle around AI. Some of that hype was fueled by the 2023 DeepMind announcement of the discovery of “millions of new materials,” a claim that, in retrospect, clearly overpromised. And it was further fueled when an MIT economics student posted a paper in late 2024 claiming that a large, unnamed corporate R&D lab had used AI to efficiently invent a slew of new materials. AI, it seemed, was already revolutionizing the industry. A few months later, the MIT economics department concluded that “the paper should be withdrawn from public discourse.” Two prominent MIT economists who are acknowledged in a footnote in the paper added that they had “no confidence in the provenance, reliability or validity of the data and the veracity of the research.” Can AI move beyond the hype and false hopes and truly transform materials discovery?", "word_count": 208, "source_key": "mit_tech", "source_name": "MIT Technology Review", "article_id": "mit_tech_7eb52bddcd44", "article_title": "AI materials discovery now needs to move into the real world", "article_url": "https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/15/1129210/ai-materials-science-discovery-startups-investment/", "paragraph_indices": [19], "score": 3, "priority": "LOW", "score_breakdown": {"absolute_strong": 0, "absolute_weak": 0, "regular_pairs": 0, "linguistic": 3, "semantic": 0, "penalties": 0}, "markers_found": {"absolute": [], "regular": ["community"], "linguistic": ["modal_verbs", "normative_language", "epistemic_markers"], "antipatterns": []}}

She says her studies have found drones to be game changers for getting medical supplies to underserved populations, and if the FAA extends these regulatory changes, it could have a real impact. That’s especially true in the steps leading up to an organ transplant, she says. Before an organ can be transmitted to a recipient, a number of blood tests must be sent back-and-forth to make sure the recipient can accept it, which takes a time if the blood is being transferred by car or even helicopter. “In these cases, the clock is ticking,” Enayati says.", "word_count": 187, "source_key": "mit_tech", "source_name": "MIT Technology Review", "article_id": "mit_tech_48e06fb1f5ea", "article_title": "What’s next for drones", "article_url": "https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/08/16/1096517/whats-next-for-drones/", "paragraph_indices": [7], "score": 3, "priority": "LOW", "score_breakdown": {"absolute_strong": 0, "absolute_weak": 0, "regular_pairs": 0, "linguistic": 3, "semantic": 0, "penalties": 0}, "markers_found": {"absolute": [], "regular": [], "linguistic": ["modal_verbs", "normative_language", "epistemic_markers"], "antipatterns": []}}

{"id": "PP643", "text": "Louis County, where Duluth is located, said the church community’s lack of cooperation was a major factor in the delay in bringing charges against Massie. Yet none of the preachers have been charged for failing to report the abuse, even though clergy are mandatory reporters under state law. Kimberly Lowe, a lawyer for the church, said its preachers are unpaid.

It was created in 2008 to provide care for people who couldn’t afford medical treatment. More than 15 years later, the need has changed little. Today, Albany has one of the highest poverty rates in the state. About 16% of residents are uninsured, nearly double the national average. And people here pay some of the highest commercial health insurance rates in the country. Not far from the Samaritan Clinic is Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital, Southwest Georgia’s largest hospital — a nonprofit founded on the principle that patients should be treated regardless of their ability to pay.

In just over nine months back in office, roughly 10,000 people have filed petitions for pardons or commutations, about two-thirds the total of the 14,867 applications submitted during the entire Biden presidency. Under Justice Department standards and requirements, people seeking pardons generally must wait five years after their release from incarceration, demonstrate good conduct and remorse, and file petitions through the Office of the Pardon Attorney. But Trump’s actions in his second term show he has largely abandoned that process. Those who have followed the rules are still waiting. They include small-business owners with decades-old fraud cases, veterans seeking to regain the gun rights that were stripped away with their convictions and people working jobs far below their experience because of the stigma of a criminal record. “It’s unfair to the little guy,” said Margaret Love, who served as pardon attorney from 1990 to 1997 under Presidents George H.W.", "word_count": 199, "source_key": "propublica", "source_name": "ProPublica", "article_id": "propublica_dcfab690df13", "article_title": "How Trump Has Exploited Pardons and Clemency to Reward Allies and Supporters", "article_url": "https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-pardons-clemency-george-santos-ed-martin", "paragraph_indices": [18], "score": 3, "priority": "LOW", "score_breakdown": {"absolute_strong": 0, "absolute_weak": 0, "regular_pairs": 1, "linguistic": 4, "semantic": 0, "penalties": -2}, "markers_found": {"absolute": [], "regular": ["rights", "justice", "experience"], "linguistic": ["modal_verbs", "evaluative_language", "causal_inferential", "abstract_nouns"], "antipatterns": ["MILD: \\bserved as\\b"]}}

One big change with the Idaho Medical Freedom Act is how schools and day cares can respond if, or when, measles arrives.

If you have asthma or COPD, you fall in this category, but so do young children (under age 5), older adults (over 65), and pregnant people. “The younger the child is, the faster their breathing, and so pound for pound, they are breathing more air pollution,” said Lisa Patel, a Stanford professor of pediatrics and an executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health. “We use 5 as a cut-off for particular vulnerabilities because age 0-5 is a period of really rapid lung growth.", "word_count": 211, "source_key": "vox", "source_name": "Vox", "article_id": "vox_ac54de420c3c", "article_title": "The Air Quality Index and how to use it, explained", "article_url": "https://www.vox.com/climate/23769186/bad-air-quality-index-wildfires-pollution", "paragraph_indices": [3], "score": 3, "priority": "LOW", "score_breakdown": {"absolute_strong": 0, "absolute_weak": 0, "regular_pairs": 0, "linguistic": 3, "semantic": 0, "penalties": 0}, "markers_found": {"absolute": [], "regular": ["understanding"], "linguistic": ["modal_verbs", "evaluative_language", "causal_inferential"], "antipatterns": []}}

By monitoring the AQI regularly and paying close attention to any symptoms, you can get a feel for the level at which you should take proactive action.

When he tells me about how it feels to help someone find their records, he scrunches up his eyes. “It gives me hope,” he says. “I just know that what we’re doing now is going to better the possibility of helping somebody.", "word_count": 150, "source_key": "wired", "source_name": "Wired", "article_id": "wired_47d21a0b3945", "article_title": "The Night 17 Million Precious Military Records Went Up in Smoke", "article_url": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-night-17-million-precious-military-records-went-up-in-smoke/", "paragraph_indices": [36], "score": 3, "priority": "LOW", "score_breakdown": {"absolute_strong": 0, "absolute_weak": 0, "regular_pairs": 0, "linguistic": 3, "semantic": 0, "penalties": 0}, "markers_found": {"absolute": [], "regular": [], "linguistic": ["modal_verbs", "evaluative_language", "epistemic_markers"], "antipatterns": []}}

More Ehmans appear: Charles, Clement, David, Dennis, Earl, Elizabeth. “Come on,” Owens implores, as if willing his favorite sprinter to cross the finish line first. But now we’re back to Ehmen. He sighs, keeps scrolling, keeps narrating. The tone of his voice has turned from excited to apprehensive. I can see the progress bar is almost to the bottom of the file, and my stomach drops. We’re not going to find him. Then, just before we reach the end, I catch a glimpse of “Abraham,” Grandfather’s middle name. “Th- th- th-,” I stammer incomprehensibly, and loudly, fumbling to point him to the right card.

{"id": "WIR972", "text": "His investigation of an outbreak at the Amoy Gardens apartment complex provided the strongest evidence that a coronavirus could be airborne. But in the intervening decades, he’d also struggled to convince the public health community that their risk calculus was off. Eventually, he decided to work out the math. Li’s elegant simulations showed that when a person coughed or sneezed, the heavy droplets were too few and the targets—an open mouth, nostrils, eyes—too small to account for much infection. Li’s team had concluded, therefore, that the public health establishment had it backward and that most colds, flu, and other respiratory illnesses must spread through aerosols instead. Their findings, they argued, exposed the fallacy of the 5-micron boundary. And they’d gone a step further, tracing the number back to a decades-old document the CDC had published for hospitals. Marr couldn’t help but feel a surge of excitement. A journal had asked her to review Li’s paper, and she didn’t mask her feelings as she sketched out her reply.", "word_count": 167, "source_key": "wired", "source_name": "Wired", "article_id": "wired_db5d91f9769e", "article_title": "The 60-Year-Old Scientific Screwup That Helped Covid Kill", "article_url": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-teeny-tiny-scientific-screwup-that-helped-covid-kill/", "paragraph_indices": [9], "score": 3, "priority": "LOW", "score_breakdown": {"absolute_strong": 0, "absolute_weak": 0, "regular_pairs": 0, "linguistic": 3, "semantic": 0, "penalties": 0}, "markers_found": {"absolute": [], "regular": ["community"], "linguistic": ["modal_verbs", "causal_inferential", "epistemic_markers"], "antipatterns": []}}
{"id": "WIR988", "text": "But because that term has a specific meaning in the medical community, she admits to avoiding it—and emphasizing instead the types of settings that pose the biggest risks. Does she think that decision has harmed the public health response, or cost lives? No, she says. “People know what they need to do to protect themselves.” Yet she admits it may be time to rethink the old droplet-airborne dichotomy. According to Van Kerkhove, the WHO plans to formally review its definitions for describing disease transmission in 2021. For Yuguo Li, whose work had so inspired Marr, these moves have given him a sliver of hope. “Tragedy always teaches us something,” he says. The lesson he thinks people are finally starting to learn is that airborne transmission is both more complicated and less scary than once believed. SARS-CoV-2, like many respiratory diseases, is airborne, but not wildly so. It isn’t like measles, which is so contagious it infects 90 percent of susceptible people exposed to someone with the virus.", "word_count": 167, "source_key": "wired", "source_name": "Wired", "article_id": "wired_db5d91f9769e", "article_title": "The 60-Year-Old Scientific Screwup That Helped Covid Kill", "article_url": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-teeny-tiny-scientific-screwup-that-helped-covid-kill/", "paragraph_indices": [25], "score": 3, "priority": "LOW", "score_breakdown": {"absolute_strong": 0, "absolute_weak": 0, "regular_pairs": 0, "linguistic": 3, "semantic": 0, "penalties": 0}, "markers_found": {"absolute": [], "regular": ["community"], "linguistic": ["modal_verbs", "causal_inferential", "epistemic_markers"], "antipatterns": []}}
