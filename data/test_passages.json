The government argues this justifies increased investment in prison reform, citing long-term economic savings that outweigh initial costs. Critics maintain that offenders deserve punishment proportional to their crimes, regardless of whether rehabilitation is cost-effective. Ministry officials emphasise that the economic savings alone make the programme worthwhile, projecting a net benefit of £2.1 billion over the next decade.",

The research team argues that these findings could revolutionise criminal sentencing by providing objective biological markers for risk assessment. However, several ethicists have cautioned that reducing human behaviour to neural activity ignores the irreducible complexity of moral agency and the lived experience of individuals navigating difficult circumstances.",
